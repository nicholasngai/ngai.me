    <p class="author__bio">
      I&rsquo;m a second-year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Unviersity of
      California, Berkeley. I work in research studying oblivious systems to offload remote computation while keeping
      data confidential, and I have taught the undergraduate CS 161 Computer Security course since Spring 2020 as both a
      TA and an instructor.
